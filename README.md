# Intelligent-Document-Analysis-System

Developed a Python-based system to analyze uploaded documents for plagiarism detection, similarity scoring, sentiment analysis, and content grading. The project includes a feedback mechanism that provides short, point-wise insights into the quality of the content, writing style, and originality.

Key Features:
1. Plagiarism Detection: Calculates similarity scores using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
2. Grading System: Assigns grades based on originality levels.
3. Sentiment Analysis: Assesses the tone of the document (positive, neutral, or negative).
4. Writing Style Analysis: Evaluates sentence structure and vocabulary richness.
5. Point-Wise Feedback: Generates concise and actionable feedback.

Technologies Used: Python, NLTK, TextBlob, scikit-learn, Google Colab, and chardet for encoding detection.

Outcome: Enhanced document evaluation and feedback generation for educational or professional use cases.
